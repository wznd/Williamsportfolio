<div class="paragraph content">Bebe Voyage, a parent run Facebook community for travelers and their families, wanted a new platform to provide members with information and expand their business. </div>
<div class="paragraph content">BBV's main appeal to users came from the sense of community they provided with their Facebook group and its crowdsourced travel information, but this was also a weakness as the info was not organized in an accessible way. <br/></div>
<div class="paragraph">Users complained that the same questions were being asked repeatedly and my design team's job was to provide a new design strategy for Bebe Voyage.</div>

<h2 class="section-header">What was the user perspective?<br/></h2>
<div class="paragraph content">We read about our user’s demographic trends in our domain research, but we wanted to get the most accurate data and hear directly from the users what they had to say about the community.<br/></div>
<div class="paragraph">Specifically, we wanted to get a better grasp of the following:<br/></div>
<ol class="list-3">
<li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-7">How does BBV offer value to its users?</strong><br/></li>
<li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-7">What unexpected issues did the users experience?</strong><br/></li>
<li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-8">What were some key opportunities for BBV?</strong><br/></li>
</ol>
<div class="div-block"></div>
<div class="paragraph">After going through a round of user interviews, my team discovered the following trends:</div>
<ol class="list-3">
<li class="list-item">Our users wanted to get streamlined information on traveling that was provided by a trusted source. This came in the form of chatting with other parents who had previous experience or more personal ways, such as seeing user-generated content such as pictures of families while traveling.</li>
<li class="list-item">A major theme we would learn about was that the website had a high bounce rate. Many users did not use it because they found it was hard to navigate and it did not provide much value over the Facebook community. Some users didn’t even know about it the website.</li>
<li class="list-item">It came to our attention that a centralized source of information needed to exist outside the Facebook group, which had become bogged down by repeated questions. According to the users, the Facebook community should be a private place to share personal travel stories and ask personalized questions about destinations.</li>
</ol>
<div class="paragraph">To visualize the key traits of our users, their specific needs, and what could be provided as a solution, my team created a problem statement to determine and summarize the core problem that was to be solved by our minimum viable product. </div>

<p class="paragraph">The results for the usability came in and were positive overall. Our tested users said that they felt the information they were looking for in our prototype was intuitive to reach. They remarked that the ability for members to leave and read reviews on the website made it feel like they were in a place that they could trust to help them out.<br/></p>

<p class="paragraph content">Some common suggestions from users were easy to implement as iterations to our design. This came in the form of revising age group classification, adding a buy button directly to the website and adding “What to Bring” to destinations. <br/></p>
<p class="paragraph">Other suggestions were documented but would require further testing to properly implement. These included greater platform personalization, standardizing content and better utilizing geolocation for engaging family activities.<br/></p>

<h2 class="section-header">Conclusion<br/></h2>
<p class="paragraph content">With our mobile website redesign, we created a platform that was easy for users to navigate through both a visual map and text-based formats, provided the information they wanted to learn about their travel needs, and still provided elements of personalization as well as user engagement.<br/></p>
<p class="paragraph content">In our final hand-off for reference, we included an executive summary to define what each deliverable was for. Because we deviated from the original idea of an app, we needed to provide documentation in detailing project decisions, such as why we chose to create a responsive website and how the client can refer to each deliverable our hand-off. <br/></p>
<p class="paragraph content">This project helped me grow as a designer most in terms of gauging what users prioritized in a product, and how to prioritize features in an MVP. It helped solidify the notion that the first solution is not always the best solution. Although we had a solid grasp of who we were making the product for, it took three rounds of user interviews and testing to determine our MVP. The experience made me grow as a professional, as I was able to juggle the clients' requirements in a diplomatic way. <br/></p>
<p class="paragraph">Our client came out of this partnership happy because we were able to offer alternatives to their original plan that users loved. They implemented many of the IA and visual designs we suggested and internal testing 6 months after showed a large increase in website engagement and steady decline in repeated questions on the community page. <br/></p>
