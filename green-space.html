        <div class="paragraph content">While New York City public park funding has increased by 70 million over the past four years, it still makes up less than one percent of the city’s overall budget. </div>
        <div class="paragraph content">The Center for an Urban Future recently reported that the average New York City park is 73 years old, with parks in every borough nearing the end of their useful lives.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">Over the next decade, an estimated $6 billion in capital investment is needed to maintain the current park system. <br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">The NYC government’s park website is currently overloaded with poorly organized information. Through our research, we hope to find if reducing cognitive load for users increases park engagement.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">Our hope is that by providing a new method to source this information, we can bridge the gap between the community and parks and help engage and educate citizens to potentially alleviate some of the currently ignored issues and give users a more proactive role in the future of NYC parks.<br></div>

        <p class="paragraph">My team and I believed that while this information was useful, there was too much laid out in the open. It did not display information that engaged users to discover, but seemed rather like a necessary chore for people who really needed things like park permits.<br></p>

        <h2 class="section-header">What was the approach?<br></h2>
        <div class="paragraph">Now that we were beginning to understand the problem our design was solving for, our next step was to speak to park goers, our most likely user, and understand them better. Before jumping in to ideation, we needed to have a firm understanding of:<br></div>
        <div class="w-layout-grid grid-5 green">
          <p id="w-node-a00ea2f3b55e-4f41a741" class="paragraph-2">Where do park goers go when they need info on a park?</p>
          <p id="w-node-5b748b786b4a-4f41a741" class="paragraph-2">What do New Yorkers think about the state of their public parks?</p>
          <p id="w-node-c4b73845f9a4-4f41a741" class="paragraph-2">What is the typical behavior of park goers?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block"></div>
        <div class="paragraph">We reached out to New Yorkers, though both referral and guerrilla interviews in the local parks, and found about half a dozen interview candidates. From there, we found three major trends:<br></div>
        <ol class="list-3">
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-21">People generally had a positive view of their parks as places for recreation and relaxation. However, they rarely ventured out of the comfort zone, typically sticking to the parks that were most convenient. Moreover, finding actual locations within the park such as restrooms tended to be troublesome in unfamiliar parks.</strong></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-20">Most people were usually unaware of special events happening at the park. These individuals did not really have a go-to source where they could get information on both official or casual events.</strong><br></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-22">When it came to the government, most people were cynical, believing that their voices would not be heard. This causes degradation of public parks, as most NYC park-goers would rather avoid and ignore broken utilities such as water fountains and benches rather than reporting them.</strong><br></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="paragraph">With these insights in mind, we were getting a clearer picture of the user and what the users might appreciate in an online park platform. We created a problem statement summing up our findings and setting up the next stage of solving the problem.<br></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1 class="quote two description"><em>&quot;The uninformed park-goer feels lost when looking for park amenities and needs a streamlined way to locate relevant information because current resources do not fully equip them to explore unfamiliar areas within the park or do not open them up to new experiences.&quot; <br></em></h1>

        <div class="paragraph content">An underlying theme to our interview responses was that most of the people interviewed were curious about exploring other parks and events and/or willing to be more proactive with helping their community. <br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">The problem was that there were few incentives laid out clearly to them. If anything, the state of the official park&#x27;s website was a disincentive to explore because of how overwhelming it was. What this led to, we theorized, was a cycle of apathy, where the lack of incentives explore led to people feeling stuck and sticking to what they know.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">To visualize our user&#x27;s pain points during the process of finding information, we created a journey map based on a user persona who was adventurous and wished to explore activities that she could do at local parks.<br></div>

          <div class="paragraph content">The first concept addressed incentives to branch out and explore with a gamified experience. Users would primarily earn points through park trivia quizzes and missions, which would involve going to events. The ultimate prize being a tree planted within a park of the user&#x27;s choice.<strong><br></strong></div><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM.png" width="798" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-9.03.53-PM.png 2032w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 638px, 73vw" alt="" class="image-25">
          <div class="paragraph content">The second concept addressed gathering information within parks with an interactive map of every park within NYC. Information about amenities such as its condition, its distance from the user and its availability would be displayed and users would no longer have to worry about finding things within the park itself.<strong><br></strong></div><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-11.18.41-PM.png" width="798" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-11.18.41-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-11.18.41-PM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-11.18.41-PM-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-11.18.41-PM.png 1596w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 638px, 73vw" alt="" class="image-25">
          <div class="paragraph content">The third concept addressed increasing awareness of issues and events through a platform which mimicked social media. With this concept, problems that emerged in parks were envisioned to be brought out into the spotlight instead of being brushed aside, and would be solved through the power of crowdsourcing. <strong><br></strong></div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block new"></div>
        <p class="paragraph content">We tested both concepts and the users loved the idea of a game and also held the map concept in high regard because of its perceived usefulness. The third concept was not met with much enthusiasm and was dropped for the purpose of preventing our product from becoming too general.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">It was time to bring the ideas we made on paper into a testable prototype that could be interacted with on users&#x27; phones.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph">The test results were positive and showed much promise for Green Space. Users thought that the two concepts fit well together within the app and they also found that the concept was helpful in their everyday lives.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph content">One common criticism was that the toggle function was not immediately clear and that there should be further onboarding explaining such a crucial part of the product.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">An interesting user suggestion noted the fact Green Space seemed more suited to big parks like Central Park. They were curious to see how our platform would include smaller parks. We considered this a future recommendation to explore, along with reaching a wider audience of occasional or infrequent park goers as well as developing a plan to ensure government collaboration when it came to planting trees. <br></p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion<br></h2>
        <p class="paragraph content">With Green Space, I was truly able to connect product design with real world scenarios. What is the root cause of user pain points? What are the implications of the root cause? This project allowed me to think bigger in the truest sense and develop a solution that was not only enjoyable but also cut inefficiencies and find a way to give back to the community.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">Coming from an economics background, I enjoyed the idea of finding out how to optimize user&#x27;s ability to enjoy the park through incentives. I also enjoyed finding ways to connect park-goer apathy to the state of the public parks. I believe that this application of systems theory goes hand in hand with design, and it excites me to undertake a journey into this new but also strangely familiar world.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I hope to become able to apply myself and my previous experiences with my newfound design skills and bring these two together in my future endeavors. I sincerely hope to be able to bring something like Green Space into existence for the benefit of all of society.<br></p>
