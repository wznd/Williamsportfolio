        <div class="paragraph content">Public libraries are cost-free assets for their communities, providing human, written, and digital resources for those they serve. </div>
        <div class="paragraph content">Unfortunately, many people who could benefit from library services aren’t fully taking advantage of what’s available to them, either because they aren’t aware or are anxious about participating in them. <br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">My design team&#x27;s mission with NYPL Advance was to provide a digital platform which would:</div>

          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-7">Build awareness of a network of professional support and learning resources provided by the public library.</strong><br></li>

        </ol>
        <div class="paragraph content">My team spoke to library staff at several locations around the Greater New York City Area, who gave us insight into the people who frequently utilize the library. <br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">We confirmed our initial assumption that patrons who use the library resource centers generally lack access to computers, printers or the internet at home.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">Among this demographic, many are job seekers who lack skills related to technology ranging from using spreadsheets to being proficient with making a resume using a word processor.<br></div>

        <p class="paragraph content">If the NYPL already had resources for job seekers that were not being sufficiently utilized, then what could we do to draw those people in? <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">To start our process of answering this question, my team took a look at competitors within the career enrichment space, particularly sites like LinkedIn and Lynda. We did this to gain some insight on why these sites were successful and how we could seek to emulate them.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From our competitive analysis, we drew the conclusion that these sites were successful due to certain key factors:<br></p>
        <ol class="list-3">
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-16">Branding played a big part in both websites&#x27; success. Users were familiar with what they would get when using the product. This was especially true for LinkedIn, which is seen as the de-facto networking site for professionals. </strong><br></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-17">The fact that both sites had a good infrastructure in place allowed it to be easy to start for new users. It also guaranteed that there would be a wide range of companies to connect with, in the case of LinkedIn, and a wide range of subjects to learn, in the case of Lynda. </strong><br></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-18">The platforms provided a sense of direction to those who might just be starting out or looking to reenter the workforce. With LinkedIn, there were suggestions made based on user profile. With Lynda, lessons were packaged as courses, which streamlined users&#x27; ability to focus their attention on particular niches.</strong><br></li>

        <h2 class="section-header">What was the approach?<br></h2>
        <div class="paragraph content">After doing our industry research and speaking to the experts, we needed to hear directly from the patrons about their thoughts on how the library could best serve their needs.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph content">Our base criteria for interviewees were people looking to transition careers as they seemed like the ones who most likely use our product.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">We were looking to gain the following insights from our interviews:<br></div>

        </div>
        <div class="div-block"></div>
        <div class="paragraph">After going through a round of user interviews, my team discovered the following trends:</div>
        <ol class="list-3">
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-16">A major recurring theme in many of our interviews was the pressure to keep up with technological changes or face becoming irrelevant in the workspace. This was often coupled with the requirement of an online presence through sites like LinkedIn.</strong><br></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-17">Patrons love the sense of community that libraries offer and saw it as an inclusive and non-consumerist space to gather with other people. They preferred it over to cafes as a place to study and relax because of the spacious atmosphere.</strong><br></li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text-18">Librarians were seen as trusted authority figures rather than just public employees. Their expertise and ability to make referrals were appreciated. We found that it drew a parallel to the fact that many interviewees stated they lacked direction in their careers.</strong><br></li>
        </ol>
        <div class="paragraph">Summing up these insights, we created a problem statement to visualize the key traits of our users, their specific needs, and what could be provided as a solution. This problem statement would be a summary of the core problem that was to be solved by our minimum viable product.<br></div>

        <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion<br></h2>
        <p class="paragraph content">Through this project, I learned to always keep an eye out for underlying problems that users have may not be obvious from the surface and require extra digging. There were many moments that took me out of my comfort zone, such as testing with an age group that I was not familiar with. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">The biggest challenge was making an app for a demographic that professed being technologically illiterate. The core issue with our product was that our tested users were confused about the task flow as well as how the features tied into the idea of finding a job. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">My team tried to create a design that simplified the user&#x27;s journey using the product through spacious and simple visual design as well as live chat to help ease uncertain users. I now realize that I should have spent just as much effort on the onboarding process, getting users comfortable with the idea of using the app to aid their job search, and being more upfront with results rather than process.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Working on NYPL Advance was a welcome challenge. Though the results of the product did not meet expectations, I took this defeat as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and reevaluate myself as a designer. In my future work, I plan to implement a research and planning strong process that effectively uncovers nuanced user behavior.<br></p>
