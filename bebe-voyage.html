        <div class="paragraph content">Bebe Voyage, a parent run Facebook community for travelers and their families, wanted a new platform to provide members with information and expand their business. </div>
        <div class="paragraph content">BBV&#x27;s main appeal to users came from the sense of community they provided with their Facebook group and its crowdsourced travel information, but this was also a weakness as the info was not organized in an accessible way. <br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">Users complained that the same questions were being asked repeatedly and my design team&#x27;s job was to provide a new design strategy for Bebe Voyage.</div>

        <p class="paragraph content">One thing we needed to keep in mind throughout the process was how attached they were to the idea of their platform being an app, given that was the initial idea being marketed to the community before my team got involved.   <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">We wanted to have all options on the table, in case a responsive website would be a better fit for user’s needs. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Our design process started by taking a look at BBV&#x27;s current platform to understand the product better and get a sense of the design values. <br></p>

        <h2 class="section-header">What was the approach?<br></h2>
        <div class="paragraph content">We read about our user’s demographic trends in our domain research, but we wanted to get the most accurate data and hear directly from the users what they had to say about the community.<br></div>
        <div class="paragraph">Specifically, we wanted to get a better grasp of the following:<br></div>
        <div class="w-layout-grid grid-5 _5">
          <p id="w-node-a00ea2f3b55e-3641a740" class="paragraph-2">What value did BBV offer to its users?</p>
          <p id="w-node-5b748b786b4a-3641a740" class="paragraph-2">What were some unexpected issues our users had?</p>

        </div>
        <div class="div-block"></div>
        <div class="paragraph">After going through a round of user interviews, my team discovered the following trends:</div>
        <ol class="list-3">
          <li class="list-item">Our users wanted to get streamlined information on traveling that was provided by a trusted source. This came in the form of chatting with other parents who had previous experience or more personal ways, such as seeing user-generated content such as pictures of families while traveling.</li>
          <li class="list-item">A major theme we would learn about was that the website had a high bounce rate. Many users did not use it because they found it was hard to navigate and it did not provide much value over the Facebook community. Some users didn’t even know about it the website.</li>
          <li class="list-item">It came to our attention that a centralized source of information needed to exist outside the Facebook group, which had become bogged down by repeated questions. According to the users, the Facebook community should be a private place to share personal travel stories and ask personalized questions about destinations.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="paragraph">To visualize the key traits of our users, their specific needs, and what could be provided as a solution, my team created a problem statement to determine and summarize the core problem that was to be solved by our minimum viable product. </div>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph content">The reason we made the second concept a website redesign was because the current website was not up to the users&#x27; standards as a place to get information and it would make more sense logistically for the company to rework what they had in place than to scrap it for an app. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">A third concept utilizing a message board similar to Reddit was ideated but dropped because it was deemed as not providing much more value than what was already in place.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph content">We spoke with users again, this time testing our concepts as well as the current website content to draw a contrast in our results.</p>
        <p class="paragraph content">To supplement our tests with a larger dataset, we also surveyed the BBV online community on which concept they preferred.  </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion<br></h2>
        <p class="paragraph content">With our mobile website redesign, we created a platform that was easy for users to navigate through both a visual map and text-based formats, provided the information they wanted to learn about their travel needs, and still provided elements of personalization as well as user engagement.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">In our final hand-off for reference, we included an executive summary to define what each deliverable was for. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">Because we deviated from the original idea of an app, we needed to provide documentation in detailing project decisions, such as why we chose to create a responsive website and how the client can refer to each deliverable our hand-off. <br></p><img src="images/BBVimage12.png" width="629" srcset="images/BBVimage12-p-500.png 500w, images/BBVimage12-p-800.png 800w, images/BBVimage12-p-1080.png 1080w, images/BBVimage12-p-1600.png 1600w, images/BBVimage12.png 1658w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 629px" alt="" class="image-24">
        <p class="paragraph content">This project helped me grow as a designer most in terms of gauging what users prioritized in a product, and how to prioritize features in an MVP. It helped solidify the notion that the first solution is not always the best solution. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph content">Although we had a solid grasp of who we were making the product for, it took three rounds of user interviews and testing to determine our MVP. The experience made me grow as a professional, as I was able to juggle the clients&#x27; requirements in a diplomatic way. <br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Our client came out of this partnership happy because we were able to offer alternatives to their original plan that users loved.<br></p>
