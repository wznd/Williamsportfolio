          <p class="paragraph-3 p">Bebe Voyage, a parent run Facebook community for travelers and their families, wanted a new platform to provide members with information and expand their business.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">BBV&#x27;s main appeal to users came from the sense of community they provided with their Facebook group and its crowdsourced travel information, but this was also a weakness as the info was not organized in an accessible way.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">Users complained that the same questions were being asked repeatedly and my design team&#x27;s job was to provide a new design strategy for Bebe Voyage.<br></p>

        <div class="div-block-82 new">
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">We read about our user’s demographic trends in our domain research, but we wanted to get the most accurate data and hear directly from the users what they had to say about the community. Specifically, we wanted to get a better grasp of the following:<br></p>
          <ol role="list" class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text">How does BBV offer value to its users?</strong><br></li>

            <li><strong class="bold-text-3">What were some key opportunities for BBV?</strong><br></li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph-3">After going through a round of user interviews, my team discovered the following trends:<br></p>
          <ol role="list" class="list">
            <li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text">Users wanted to get streamlined information provided by a trusted source.</strong><br></li>
            <li class="list-item-2"><strong class="bold-text-2">The website had issues with poor navigation, a high bounce rate, and lack of knowledge that it even existed.</strong><br></li>
            <li><strong class="bold-text-3">Users state the Facebook group should be a community forum, not a place to ask the same questions repeadeteldy.</strong><br></li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">Overall, the users found value from the company because it gave them a space to learn from the previous experience of other parents. They could also gain a sense of community through seeing user-generated content such as pictures of families while traveling. <br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">It came to our attention that a centralized source of information needed to exist outside the Facebook group, which had become bogged down by repeated questions.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">To visualize the key traits of our users, their specific needs, and what could be provided as a solution, my team created a problem statement to determine and summarize the core problem that was to be solved by our minimum viable product.<br></p>

            <p class="paragraph-3 p ok">BBV users, as personified by Erica, wanted one source for all their travel needs. Instead of going to Amazon to buy travel products, Expedia to browse and book hotels and LonelyPlanet to view travel guides, how could we bring the experience of all three into one condensed platform?<br></p>

            <p class="paragraph-3 p ok">From our research, we found that the majority of BBV users favored mobile devices. How could we present content in an easy to understand way? How could we create a simple interface that would enable users to do more while traveling?<br></p>

          </div>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">The reason we made the second concept a website redesign was because the current website was not up to the users&#x27; standards as a place to get information and it would make more sense logistically for the company to rework what they had in place than to scrap it for an app.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">A third concept utilizing a message board similar to Reddit was ideated but dropped because it was deemed as not providing much more value than what was already in place.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">We spoke with users again, this time testing our concepts as well as the current website content to draw a contrast in our results.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">To supplement our tests with a larger dataset, we also surveyed the BBV online community on which concept they preferred.  <br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">Our results showed that users visually liked the mobile map concept better than the website redesign.<br></p>

Our tested users said that they felt the information they were looking for in our prototype was intuitive to reach.

        <h1 class="heading-2 new">Conclusion<br></h1>
        <div class="div-block-82 new">
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">With our mobile website redesign, we created a platform that was easy for users to navigate through both a visual map and text-based formats, provided the information they wanted to learn about their travel needs, and still provided elements of personalization as well as user engagement.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">In our final hand-off for reference, we included an executive summary to define what each deliverable was for. Because we deviated from the original idea of an app, we needed to provide documentation in detailing project decisions, such as why we chose to create a responsive website and how the client can refer to each deliverable our hand-off.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">This project helped me grow as a designer most in terms of gauging what users prioritized in a product, and how to prioritize features in an MVP. It helped solidify the notion that the first solution is not always the best solution. Although we had a solid grasp of who we were making the product for, it took three rounds of user interviews and testing to determine our MVP. The experience made me grow as a professional, as I was able to juggle the clients&#x27; requirements in a diplomatic way.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3 p">Our client came out of this partnership happy because we were able to offer alternatives to their original plan that users loved. They implemented many of the IA and visual designs we suggested and internal testing 6 months after showed a large increase in website engagement and steady decline in repeated questions on the community page.<br></p>
